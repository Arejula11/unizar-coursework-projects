# üéì UNIZAR Informatics Engineering Portfolio

This repository serves as a central hub for the academic projects I contributed to during my **Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Informatics Engineering** at the **University of Zaragoza (UNIZAR)**.

The projects listed here span coursework, practical assignments, and collaborative initiatives developed throughout the degree. While many are hosted in my personal GitHub repositories, others are managed by classmates or university organizations.

In addition, I completed a **semester abroad at the University of Porto**, where I participated in several international courses and contributed to collaborative projects. These are also included where applicable.

Each entry includes a brief description and a link to the corresponding repository, where you can explore the code, documentation, and additional resources.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Please note: Not every subject has an associated repository, as some projects were not hosted on GitHub or were submitted as part of group work managed by others.
