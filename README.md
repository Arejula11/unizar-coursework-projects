# üéì UNIZAR Informatics Engineering Portfolio

This repository serves as a central hub for the academic projects I contributed to during my **Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Informatics Engineering** at the **University of Zaragoza (UNIZAR)**.

The listed projects span coursework, practical assignments, and collaborative initiatives developed throughout the degree. While some projects are hosted in my personal GitHub repositories, others are maintained by classmates or university organizations.

Each entry below includes a brief description and a link to the corresponding repository, where you can explore the code, documentation, and additional resources.

There are not repositories for every subject, as some projects were not hosted on GitHub or were completed in collaboration with classmates who manage their own repositories.
